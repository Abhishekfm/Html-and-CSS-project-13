In this project I lerned about grid and used two css file and in [style](style.css) css file code is used in both but in service page to overwrite some of the property of this [style](style.css) css file I created [service](service.css) css file. and then I added link to [service](service.css) css file in [service](service.html) html file after [style](style.css) css file because page is rendered from top to down thats how [service](service.css) css file can overwrite some of the property.
